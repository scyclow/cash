      <p>The reserve price of each auction is based on the following calculation:</p>
      <code>$G/16 + (USDETH * ($U + $L/16))</code>

      <p>Where</p>
      <div class="calculation">
        <code>USDETH = 0.00064 (USD/ETH exchange rate as of 10/18/2023)</code>
        <code>$G = 0.314 (Total gas expense of deploying CASH contract + auction initialization)</code>
        <code>$U = $50.32 USD</code>
        <code>$L = 18.56 hours of labor * $15.00 (NYC minimum wage)<aside>NOTE: $L is not inclusive of labor undertaken while conceptualizing or planning for the CASH project. In addition, this does not take into account labor directed towards the creation of reusable web and smart contract-based components undertaken prior to the development of the CASH project</aside></code>
